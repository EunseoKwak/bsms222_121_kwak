#3.2.1 Objects
How to solve several quandratic equations of the form ax^2+bx+c=0. The quadratic formula gives us the solutions; but change depending on the values of a, b, and c
one advantage of programming languages; we can define variables and write expressions with these variables
general code for the quadratic equation below
if we are asked to solve x^2+x-1=0, we define

```{r}

a<- 1
b<- 1
c<- -1
```

We use <- to assign values to the variables
We can also use = but recommend against using to avoid confusion

```{r}
a
```
a more explicit way to ask R to show us that value is using print
```{r}
print(a)
```

object; describe stuff that is stored in R
objects can also be more complicated entities such as functions, which are described later

#3.2.2 The Workspace
We we define objects in the console, we are changing the workspace. You can see all the variables saved in your workspace by typing
```{r}
ls()
```

the value of a variable that is not in your workspace would give an error

to obtain a solution to our equation, we use the quadratic formula:

```{r}
(-b+sqrt(b^2-4*a*c))/(2*a)
```
```{r}
(-b-sqrt(b^2-4*a*c))/(2*a)
```

#3.2.3 Functions
you define variables; data analysis process can usually be described as a series of functions applied to the data.
install.packages, library, ls, sqrt are functions
pacakges -> do not appear in worksapce because y
ou did not define them, but available for immediate use
If you type ls, the function is not evaluated.
If you type ls() the function is evaluated and we see objects in the workspace
most functions require one or more arguments
how we assign an object to the argument of the function log:
```{r}
log(8)
log(a)
```

get help by using help function:
```{r}
help("log")
```
for most functions, we can also use
```{r}
?log
```

the help will show what arguments the function is expecting
e.g. log needs x and base to run
some arguments are required and others are optional
optional; help document; default value is assigned with =. 
the base of the function log defaults to base=exp(1) making log the natural log by default.
looking at arguments without opening the help system ->
```{r}
args(log)
```

change the default values by assigning another object;
```{r}
log(8, base=2)
```

or using x

```{r}
log(x=8, base=2)
```
if no argument name is used, R assumes you are entering arguments in the order shown in the help file or by args. So by not using the names, it assumes the arguments are x followed by base:
```{r}
log(8,2)
```

or you can use arguments' names
```{r}
log(base=2, x=8)
```

for arguments, we must use =

there are exceptions to the rule
arithmetic and relational operators
```{r}
2^3
```
you can see arithmetic operators by typing:
```{r}
help("+")
```
or
```{r}
?"+"
```

and the relational operators by typing:
```{r}
help(">")
```
or
```{r}
?">"
```

#3.2.4 Other prebuilt objects
you can see all the available datasets by typing
```{r}
data()
```
these can be used by tyg name
p
```{r}
co2
```
R will show you CO2 concentration data
mathematical quantities are other prebuilt objects
```{r}
pi
```
```{r}
Inf+1
```

#3.2.5 Variable Names
variable names can be almost anything - start with a letter, can't contain spaces, should not be variables that are predefined in R.
it's good to use meaningful words that describe ewhat is stored, use only lower case, and use underscores as a substitue for spaces
```{r}
solution_1 <- (-b+sqrt(b^2-4*a*c))/(2*a)
solution_2 <- (-b-sqrt(b^2-4*a*c))/(2*a)
```

#3.2.6 Saving your workspace
values remain in workspace until you end session or erase them with the function rm.
Workspaces can be saved for later use.
If you save it, the next time you start R, the program the workspace

we actually recommend against savying the workspace; as you start working on diff. projects, it'll be harder to keep track of what is saved.

assign the workspace a specific name. use the function save or save.image. to load, use the function load. When saving a workspace, use suffix rda or RData. OR session tab-save workspace as. You can later load it using the load workspace options in the same tab. You can read the help pages on save, save.image and load to learn more!

#3.2.7 Motivating Scripts
we can copy and paste the code agove to solve another equation such as 3x^2+2x-1
redefine the variables!
```{r}
a <- 3
b <- 2
c <- -1
(-b + sqrt(b^2 - 4*a*c)) / (2*a)
```
we can just simply change the variable names. 

#3.2.8 Commenting your code
If a line starts with the symbol #, it is not evaluated.
We can use this to write reminders or why we wrote particular code
```{r}
## Code to compute solution to quadratic equation of the form ax^2 + bx + c
## define the variables
a <- 3 
b <- 2
c <- -1

## now compute the solution
(-b + sqrt(b^2 - 4*a*c)) / (2*a)
(-b - sqrt(b^2 - 4*a*c)) / (2*a)
```

#3.3 Exercise
Q1. What is the sum of the first 100 positive integers? define n=100 and then use R to compute to the sum of 1 through 100 using the formula. What is the sum?
```{r}
#A1
sumpositive <- function(n) { result<- n*(n+1)/2
return (result)}
sumpositive(100)

```
or

```{r}
n=100
n*(n+1)/2
```

Q2. Now use the same formula to compute the sum of th eintegers from 1 through 1,000.

```{r}
#A2
sumpositive(1000)
```
or

```{r}
k=1000
k*(k+1)/2
```

Q3. Look at the result of typing this code
```{r}
n <- 1000
x <- seq(1, n)
sum(x)
```
Based on the result, what do you think the functions seq and sum do? You can use the help system:

A. sum creates a list of numbers and seq adds them up.
B. seq creates a list of numbers and sum adds them up.
C. seq computes the difference between two arguments and sum computes the sum of 1 through 1000.
D. sum always returns the same number.

```{r}
# A3
# B.
```

Q4. Use one line of code to compute the log, in base 10, of the square root of 100.

```{r}
#A4.
log(base=10, 100)
```

Q5. Which of the following will always return the numeric value stored in x?
A. log(10^x)
B. log10(x^10)
C. log(exp(x))
D. exp(log(x, base = 2))
```{r}
#A5
#C.log(exp(x))
```

#3.4 Data types
Variables in R : can be of different types
the function class helps us determine what type of object we have

```{r}
a<-2
class(a)
```

it is impt to learn diff. types of variables

#3.5 Data frames 
storing a dataset in R is in a data frame; a table with rows representing rows representing observations and diff. variables reported from each observation defining the columns.

you can access dataset by loading dslabs library and loading the murders dataset using the data function;
```{r}
library(dslabs)
data(murders)
```
to see that this is a data frame;
```{r}
class(murders)
```

#3.5.1 Examing an object
function str is uesful for finding out more about the structure of an object
```{r}
str(murders)
```
table has 51 rows, 5 variables
function head show the first six lines;
```{r}
head(murders)
```
each state is considered an observation. 5 variables are reported

#3.5.2 The acessor: $
access the diff. variables represented by columns included in this data frame.
```{r}
murders$population
```

how did we know to use population? - function str
We can quickly access variable names using
```{r}
names(murders)
```
it is impt to know that order of entries in murder$population preserves the order of the rows in our data table
R has auto-complete functionality! YEY

#3.5.3 Vectors: numerics, characters, and logical
The object murders$population is several numbers, which is called 'vectors'
single number: vvector of length 1
function length; how many entries are in the vector
```{r}
pop <- murders$population
length(pop)
```
this is numeric vector
```{r}
class(pop)
```
every entry must be a number to be a numeric vector
vectors can also be of class character
```{r}
class(murders$state)
```
All entries need to be a character to be a character vector
logical vectors; must be either true or false
```{r}
z <- 3 == 2
z
```

```{r}
class(z)
```

== is a relational operator asking if 3 is equal to 2. = is used for assigning variable and == is testing for equality
Other relational operators::
```{r}
?Comparison
```
values in popl are integers. Numbers are assigned class numeric even when they are round integers.
We can turn into class integer with the as.integer() function, OR adding like this: 1L.

#3.5.4 Factors
murders dataset; region seems to be a character vector. HOWEVER it is not:
```{r}
class(murders$region)
```
factors; useful for storing categorical data. There are only 4 regions. levels function show this
```{r}
levels(murders$region)
```
R stores levels as integers.
order: default is alphabetical order.
But often they follow different order
reorder function change the order of levels based on a summary computed on a numeric vector.
we can use reorder when there are values associated with each level
The following code takes the sum of the total murders in each region, and reorders the factor following these sums.
```{r}
region <- murders$region
value <- murders$total
region <- reorder(region, value, FUN = sum)
levels(region)
```
Factors sometimes behave like characters and sometimes they do not

#3.5.5 List
Data frames ; special case of lists
you can store any combination of different types
```{r}
record <- list("John Doe", 1234, c(95, 82, 91, 97, 93), "A")
names(record) <- c("name", "student_id", "grades", "final_grade")
record
```

```{r}
class(record)
```

you might also encounterl lists without variable names
```{r}
record2 <- list("John Doe", 1234, c(95, 82, 91, 97, 93), "A")
record2
```
You can extract components with the accessor $
```{r}
record2$student_id
```
or
```{r}
record2[["student_id"]]
```

#3.5. Matrices
Matricies are similar to data frames; two dimensional!
But entries in matrices should be all the same type
Data frames are much more useful for storing data
matrices; we can perform matrix algebra operations!
we can define a matrix using function matrix - specify the numbers of rows and columns

```{r}
mat <- matrix(1:12, 4, 3)
mat
```

you can access entries using square brackets []
second row, third column;
```{r}
mat[2, 3]
```

If you want the entire second row, you leave the column spot empty
```{r}
mat[2,]
```
this returns vector!
similarly,
```{r}
mat[,3]
```
This is also a vector, not a matrix

you can access more than one column/row
```{r}
mat[, 2:3]
```

you can subset both rows and columns
```{r}
mat[1:2, 2:3]
```

we can convert matrices into data frames using function as.data.frame
```{r}
as.data.frame(mat)
```

simply [ to access rows and columns of a data frame
```{r}
data("murders")
murders[25, 1]
murders[2:3, ]
```
#3.6 Exercise
Q1.
```{r}
library(dslabs)
data(murders)
```
use function str to examine structure of the murders object. which of the following best describes the variables represented in this data frame?
A. The 51 States
B. The murder rates for all 50 states and DC.
C. The state name, the abbreviation of the state name, the state’s region, and the state’s population and total number of murders for 2010.
D. str shows no relevant information.
```{r}
#A1
str(murders)
#C
```
Q2. What are the column names used by the data frame for these five variables?
A2. state, abb, region, populationn, total

Q3.Use the accessor $ to extract the state abbreviations and assign them to the object a. What is the class of this object?

```{r}
#A3
a<- murders$abb
class(a)
```

Q4. use the square brackets to extract the state abbreviations and assign them to the object b. Use the identical function to determine if a and b are the same.
```{r}
#A4
b <- murders[["abb"]]
a==b
```

Q5.
region column stores a factor
```{r}
class(murders$region)
```
use the function levels and length to determine the number of regions defined by this dataset.

```{r}
#A5
length(murders$region)
levels(murders$region)

```


Q6.
The function table takes a vector and returns the frequency of each element. You can see how many states are in each region by applying this function. Use this function in one line of code to create a table of states per region.

```{r}
#A6
table(murders$region)
```
